The codebase was developed to create a timed code quiz. 
-Upon clicking the Start button, the timer begins decrementing and the user is presented with a series of questions with multiple choice answers. 

-When the answer is clicked (right or wrong) the user is taken to the next question. 

-With each right answer their score increases by 1, and is displayed on the page
once the game has ended. 

Known Issues:

There were several pieces I was unable to complete. I commented out my attempts in the codebase. 
-I was able to save user input to local storage, and display initials on the highscores page, however I was unable to save these as a log, and I couldn't get the scores to display alongside the initials.

-I was also unable to get the countdown clock to have time deducted when a wrong answer is chosen.

-I wish I had more time to work on the styling elements, but I saved that to the end in order to ensure the functionality of the website.
