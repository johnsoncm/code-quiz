The codebase was developed to create a timed code quiz. 
Upon clicking the Start button, the timer begins decrementing and the user is presented with a series
of questions with multiple choice answers. When the answer is clicked (right or wrong)
the user is taken to the next question. With each right answer their score increases by 1, and is displayed on the page
once the game has ended.
